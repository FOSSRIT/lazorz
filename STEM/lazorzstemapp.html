<h2>■ Entry Title</h2>
    Lazorz

<h2>■ Executive Summary</h2>

<h2>■ Concept Overview:</h2>

    <h3>What is your Project?</h3>

    <p>
    Our project is an educational game built with open web technologies
    (HTML5/JavaScript) that focuses on the physics of light, reflection, and
    color.
    </p>

    <h3>At what stage of development is the Project?</h3>

    <p>
    Our project is at the playable prototype stage. Our basic game mechanics
    and engines have been implemented, with basic art assets and sprites. The
    project is ready for play testing, and our team will be seeking community
    contributions such as levels, art, and feature improvements after the
    conclusion of the STEM challenge. Our game has been deployed, and is
    available at: <a

    </p>

<h2>■ Educational Value Proposition and Impact:</h2>

    <h3>What educational need(s) does your Project aim to address?</h3>

    <p>
    In our research, we identified several educational needs addressed in
    literature and reports for our home state of New York.
    </p>

    <p>
    Based on the New York State Education Department's Core Curriculum for
    Intermediate Level Science (Grades 5-8) [1], we are addressing performance
    indicator 4.4b--the Major Understanding that "Light passes through some
    materials, sometimes refracting in the process. Materials absorb and
    reflect light, and may transmit light."
    </p>

    <p>
    Our game helps students to "Construct explanations independently for
    natural phenomena, especially by proposing preliminary visual models of
    phenomena" listed under Key Idea 1, in the section <em>Scientific Inquiry:
    Analysis, Inquiry, and Design</em> Standard 1.2.
    </p>

    <p>
    According to the New York State Education Department's Core Curriculum for
    Elementary Level Sciences (Grades K-4) [2], our game helps to illustrate
    <em>"reflectiveness of light"</em> and <em>"Light, Shadow, and
    Color"</em>--listed as two Major Understandings of the Physical Setting.
    </p>

    <p>
    The New York City K-8 Science Scope and Sequence [3] regards "lighting and
    shadows" within scope as early as the <em>Grade 1 Properties of Matter</em>
    unit.
    </p>

    <p>
    In examining the New York City High School Science Regents Scope & Sequence
    [4] our game helps to prepare intermediate students to address concepts
    covered in <em>Physics: Unit 6</em> on light reflection.
    </p>


    <h3>How have you been/will you measure educational impact?</h3>

    <p>Educational impact can be measured though quantitative results such as
    website traffic, source code forks, user contributions, and email
    feedback.</p>

    <p>Qualitative impact will be built into the game itself by including
    features such as a leader-board, and timed results for each player on each
    level.</p>

    <p>Outside of the game, we will conduct entrance and exit surveys for
    play-testers within our target demographic, as well as their parents,
    teachers, and mentors, to help measure the impact and engagement
    capabilities of our game. Social impact and classroom engagement are just
    as much a goal of this project as STEM education. It is our belief that
    children who work and play well with others tend to be more engaged in
    classroom and group activity.</p>

<h2>■ Research:</h2>

    <h3>What research theories or evidence are driving the development of your
    Project? What, if any, research has been done, and what are the outcomes?</h3>

    <p>
    Primarily the research done for this project was market research. We Picked
    the educational elements to focus on first, and found that there were
    multiple laser simulation games, and it was a quite popular educational
    game mechanic. There are several physical [6] and digital models, but we
    wanted to improve the playability and social aspects of these games, while
    adding features like color filtering and multi-player support. The outcome
    is we are improving on a classic concept used by other projects, based on
    play-testing done on other projects in the field.  </p>

<h2>■ Contribution to the field of STEM Learning:</h2>

    <h3>How does your Project address the challenge of STEM curriculum through
    digital gaming?</h3>

    <p>
    Gaming is second nature for many children. Though anecdotal, we conducted
    an un-official survey of some of our classmates and colleagues about whey
    they got involved in computing and programming. When asked, "Where did your
    interest start?" each one of the (8) people we asked responded with either
    console gaming or PC Gaming when they were younglings.
    </p>

    <p>
    By not only using Open web technologies to build our game, but leveraging
    them to offer our source code and game assets open source, we are
    encouraging users to "pop the hood" and dive into the code, to request
    features and report bugs, to be part of the discussion on our mailing list.
    These are all standard practices in many open source projects, and the
    sooner students engage in communities like this, the more likely they are
    to pursue careers in engineering and programming. This project is not just
    a game, but with any luck will develop into a community where students can
    feel comfortable asking for help, asking for specific changes, and
    eventually create content and puzzles for their peers and future students.
    </p>


<h2>■ Playability:</h2>

    <h3>How does the Project work?</h3>

    <p>
    Players are presented with a 10x10 grid, with a bottom row of buttons. On
    the grid there are tiles representing beams of light, and obstacles. The
    object of the game is to place reflective mirrors on the grid to direct the
    beam around obstacles to the end tile to solve the puzzle. Some puzzles
    require the beam to be filtered through a certain color.
    </p>

    <p>
    The user interface was designed with both desktop and mobile screens taken
    into consideration. Both mouse and touch screen inputs were accounted for
    when handling user input during game play.
    </p>

    <p>
    Levels were designed to naturally progress in difficulty while introducing
    players to new tools. The first level simply requires a mirror to be placed
    in the correct position. The second level requires the player to rotate the
    mirror. The third level introduces obstacles, and the fourth level
    introduces colored filters. This gradual increase in difficulty works well
    as a tutorial of the features and tools available in the current version of
    the game, and serves as a proof of concept of game elements and mechanics.
    </p>

<h2>■ Potential for Scale:</h2>

    <h3>Does your Project have potential for broad scale impact? What is the
        feasibility of mass production, marketing and distribution?</h3>

    <p>This game was designed to be simple, and meet the lowest common
    denominators in usability and technical requirements.</p>

    <p>If we were to produce physical copies of the game, our it would only
    need .013% of the space on a 650MB Compact Disc. In fact, our game could
    fit onto a 3.5inch Floppy Disk if it had to!</p>

    <p>As our game playable via the web, distribution is a matter of directing
    prospective users to a URL, where they can choose to play the game, or
    download a local copy.</p>

    <p>Scaling the game is as straight forward as adding more nodes to our
    cloud-based deployment. Our project is deployed on Red Hat's Openshift
    platform (http://openshift.redhat.com), which is backed by Amazon's Elastic
    Compute Cloud (EC2). If we were to experience an increase in users and
    traffic, there are upgrade paths provided by our Platform as a Service
    (Paas) provider to accommodate increased traffic.</p>

    <p>We may be biased, but we feel there is a very high potential for broad
    scale impact.  This is based on the popularity of other physical and
    digital laser games and our intention to target mobile platforms and the XO
    Laptop of One Laptop Per Child. We feel we are targeting the broadest
    device penetration for developing nations, while using the most up-to-date
    open web technologies, and engaging the largest potential developer
    communities.</p>


    <h3>Please outline your thoughts around an implementation plan.</h3>

    <p>See "Next Steps" portion of the application</p>

<h2>■ Underserved Communities:</h2>

    <h3> How can your Project be made available on a platform that is
    accessible to underserved communities, such as to being played via a
    dial-up internet connection with a standard web browser or mobile phones
    that have limited connectivity and functionality.</h3>

    <p>The code itself is "free standing." Meaning that if have a copy of the
    files locally on your device, you can play the game locally without the
    need of an internet connection. The current version of the game requires
    less than 1MB of space. If someone were using a dial-up internet connection
    (maximum speed of 56kbps), even at 25% speeds (12kbps), it would take just
    over one minute (~66 seconds) to download all the files and game assets. To
    play the game, you need only a standard web-browser (which again, does not
    need access to the internet) so users won't have to download any additional
    software or plug-ins onto their device.</p>

    <p> Users who want to play the game from a touch-screen mobile device or
    tablet experience the same interface and game play elements as on a
    desktop. The resolution of the game grid and interface were designed with
    small screens in mind. Each tile is a mere 48x48 pixels; the favicon
    inside your browser's address bar is usually between 12-36 pixels wide.
    This makes the most resource intensive game assets as manageable as
    possible. It is a very simple, but very effective solution.
    </p>

    <p> Users who want to play the game from the internet on a desktop, need
    only a web-browser. Our team developed grid and beam engines that use
    simple 2D vector graphics that require minimal amounts of processing power
    and bandwidth to render. If a device can render a web page, it has all the
    power it needs to handle rendering our game.</p>

    <p>2 out of our 3 team members have been involved in making games for the
    One Laptop Per Child Project [5]. Our longterm goal is to ensure that this
    game runs on this platform, of which over 1.5 million units have been
    deployed in developing countries world wide.</p>
